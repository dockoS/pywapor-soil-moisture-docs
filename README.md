# PyWaPOR Soil Moisture Documentation

This repository contains technical documentation for understanding and customizing the soil moisture calculation in the PyWaPOR library.

## Contents

1. **[Relative Soil Moisture Technical Documentation](relative_soil_moisture_technical_documentation.md)** - Detailed explanation of the theoretical framework, implementation, and code details for relative soil moisture calculation in PyWaPOR.

2. **[Soil Moisture Parameter Sources](soil_moisture_parameter_sources.md)** - Comprehensive guide on where to obtain each parameter required for the soil moisture calculation, including data sources and preprocessing steps.

## Purpose

This documentation is intended for researchers and developers who want to:
- Understand the scientific principles behind PyWaPOR's soil moisture calculation
- Customize the soil moisture calculation for specific applications
- Locate and prepare all necessary input data for the calculation
- Understand the downscaling process for achieving 10-meter resolution
